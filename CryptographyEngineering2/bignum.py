'''
Write a library of functions for operations on positive big numbers expressed 
in base B (=integer>1; B itself is not a bignum). Include all nine that are 
def'd below. Use the small-endian order: the least significant digit (LSD) 
comes first in a list and the most sigfnicant digit (MSD) last. It works like 
this when N is a list containing a bignum:

    Bto10, though). 
    So, tentoB(541,5) returns [1, 3, 1, 4].
    To be useful, the library must include a version of both conversions 
    (10 -> B -> 10), where the decimal representation is a not a number
